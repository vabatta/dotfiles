# Show me your work

For work a human reviews after the fact, a decision trail lets them reconstruct what was decided, why, and on what evidence, without rerunning the work or reading the whole transcript. Keep one canonical log so the trail is consistent and a future agent can find it.

## The format

A single TSV file, one row per decision. TSV because GitHub renders it as a sortable table, `column -s$'\t' -t` and spreadsheets read it, and a row appends with one command. Cells stay single-line. Evidence is a pointer, not prose.

`scripts/log.sh` writes the header on first use, so copying `references/decision-log-template.tsv` is only needed for manual appends. Columns:

- **ts.** ISO8601 timestamp. The timeline axis.
- **phase.** The phase or workstream.
- **decision.** What was chosen or done, one line.
- **why.** The reason in plain words. If a principle drove it, say it plainly (`explored options first, this was a one-way door`), not as a jargon tag.
- **evidence.** A link or path that proves it: commit SHA, PR number, `file:line`, or an artifact, trace, or screenshot path. Never a paragraph.
- **result.** The outcome or predicate state: `tests green`, `reverted`, `pixel-diff 0`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, `open`.

An example, plain-spoken so a reviewer reads it at a glance. This is illustration only; don't copy these rows into a real log.

```
ts	phase	decision	why	evidence	result
2026-05-24T09:02:00Z	frame	counted the work first, about 100 components and roughly 75 hours	wanted to know the size before starting a long run	commit 3a9f1c2	found 5 things to sort out before starting
2026-05-24T09:40:00Z	harness	took screenshots of the old version before changing anything	so we can compare old against new and catch any visual change	scripts/snapshot.sh, baseline/	saved 120 reference screenshots
2026-05-24T11:15:00Z	widget	moved the widget styles over without changing how it looks	keep the change small and the result identical	commit 7c21e0a, pixel-diff 0	looks identical, tests pass
2026-05-24T12:30:00Z	widget	threw out a helper's work because its screenshots were blank	checked the real files instead of trusting its summary	worktree reset	reverted, tightened the instructions for next time
```

## Logging a row

Write each entry the way a teammate would be told what was done. Plain words, concrete actions, no AI speak or abstract jargon (the **unslop** skill applies to log text too). A reviewer should understand each row without decoding it.

Use the helper (path relative to this skill's directory) so rows stay well-formed: `scripts/log.sh <logfile> <phase> <decision> <why> <evidence> <result>`. It stamps `ts`, writes the header on first use, strips stray tabs/newlines, and prefixes any cell starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@` with a single quote so a reviewer opening the log in a spreadsheet doesn't trigger formula execution. The leading quote is expected in a terminal view. A bare `printf` appending a row works too, but mind those same bytes if cells come from generated or user-supplied text.

Log decision points and checkpoints, not every action: a fork chosen, a unit completed with its verification result, a pivot or revert with its trigger, a blocker surfaced, a gate fixed. For loop runs, one row per iteration. Skip the trivial and self-evident.

## Where it lives

By default the log is a working artifact, not committed. Keep it at `.agent/decisions/<slug>.tsv`. Most work doesn't need a committed trail; the local log still keeps the run honest and can be discarded after.

When the work is ambitious enough that a reviewer needs the trail to trust the result, promote it to `docs/decisions/<slug>.tsv` and commit it: a large cross-language port, a multi-week migration, anything where confidence has to be shown rather than assumed. A committed log renders as a table in the PR.

## Rules

- One row is one decision or checkpoint. If it doesn't fit on one line, the decision isn't crisp yet.
- Append-only once handed over. A wrong call gets a new row that supersedes it. The audit below may edit the working log before handover.
- Prefer evidence produced by committed scripts over hand-made one-offs, so a reviewer can re-run it (**principle-encode-lessons-in-structure**).

## Audit the log against the work

At the end of the run, before handing back, check that the log matches what
actually happened. Compare it with a host-provided session record when one is
available, then inspect the files, commands, and artifacts named as evidence.

- Every row maps to a real action. Cut invented or aspirational entries.
- Each row's evidence resolves and shows what the row claims.
- A fork, pivot, or abandoned approach that shaped the work but isn't logged is a gap. Add it.
- Drop padding. If nobody would audit a row, it doesn't earn its place.

Fix the log, not the story. If the work diverged from what a row claims, the row is wrong.

## Cross-model review of the trail

Required for a promoted or ambitious trail. Before handing back, fan out a read-only reviewer per **delegate**, asking for diverse coverage so the reviewer runs on a different model from the one that did the work. The point is fresh eyes the author cannot bring. For any other trail, or when no reviewer can run, self-review and write `reviewed by none (self only)`. The subagent reads the audit trail and the run's transcript, then flags what the user should pay attention to. Not a redo of the work, a scan for what's suboptimal or risky.

- Decisions logged with weak or absent evidence.
- Verification steps skipped or claimed without proof in the transcript.
- Choices that look risky in hindsight (premature, scope-creeping, papering over a symptom).
- Gaps the user would otherwise miss on a casual skim.

Every reply for a run that produced a trail ends with an "Attention" section. Lead with the reviewer's model on its own line (`reviewed by <model>` or `reviewed by none (self only)`), then list each flag pointing to specific rows or moments. "No flags" is a valid value; the model name is not. Done when the section names a reviewer line and every flag cites a row. The self-audit asks if the log told the truth; this asks what the user should still scrutinize even when it did.

## Reviewing the trail

Read top to bottom, follow the evidence pointers, spot-check. GitHub renders a committed TSV as a table; `column -s$'\t' -t <logfile>` renders it in a terminal. A row whose evidence doesn't resolve, or whose result is unverified, is the audit catching a gap.

## Composing this skill

Other skills route their audit trail here instead of inventing one. Reference it by name and let it own the format; don't restate the columns.
